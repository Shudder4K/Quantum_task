#Named Entity Recognition for Mountain Names
#This notebook demonstrates the development of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline for identifying and tagging mountain names in a text corpus. The process #involves generating a custom NER dataset, training a BERT-based model, and visualizing the results.

#Notebook Overview
#1. Generating the NER Dataset
Purpose: Create a labeled dataset for training an NER model on mountain-related texts.
Process:
Define a list of mountain names (e.g., "Everest", "Kilimanjaro").
Generate text samples embedding these names in context.
Annotate the texts with B-MOUNTAIN (beginning of a mountain name) and I-MOUNTAIN (inside a mountain name) tags.
Save the dataset in CoNLL format.
#2. Parsing the Dataset
Objective: Read the CoNLL file and prepare it for model training.
Steps:
Parse sentences and their corresponding labels from the CoNLL file.
Structure the data for tokenization and alignment.
#3. Training the NER Model
Purpose: Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for mountain name recognition.
Process:
Use the BertTokenizerFast to tokenize sentences while aligning labels.
Fine-tune BertForTokenClassification using the tokenized dataset.
Split the dataset into training and validation sets for evaluation.
Configure and run the Trainer for model training.
#4. Inference and Visualization
Objective: Apply the trained NER model to identify mountain names in new text.
Steps:
Use the trained model to predict entities in sample text.
Convert predictions into a Spacy-compatible format.
Render visualizations using Spacy's displacy and save them as HTML.
Outputs
Trained NER model saved to disk.
Annotated text with identified mountain names.
Visualization of NER results in HTML format.
Requirements
Libraries: transformers, torch, spacy, sklearn, bs4
Dataset: Custom-generated CoNLL file with mountain names and their contexts.
Conclusion
This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for training a custom NER model to identify mountain names in text. The method can be adapted for other domains requiring domain-specific NER models.
